# Migration Summary: Ollama to Foundation Models

## Overview

Yankovinator has been migrated from using Ollama (external LLM service) to Apple's Foundation Models framework (on-device AI). This migration provides better integration, no external dependencies, and improved performance on Apple devices.

## Changes Made

### Code Changes

1. **Removed OllamaClient.swift**
   - Deleted the entire Ollama client implementation
   - Removed dependency on AsyncHTTPClient

2. **Created FoundationModelsClient.swift**
   - New client using Apple's Foundation Models framework
   - On-device AI processing (no external service required)
   - Requires macOS 15.0+ or iOS 18.0+

3. **Updated ParodyGenerator.swift**
   - Replaced `OllamaClient` with `FoundationModelsClient`
   - Updated all method calls to use Foundation Models API
   - Removed Ollama-specific error handling

4. **Updated CLI Tools**
   - **YankovinatorCLI**: Removed `--ollama-url` and `--model` options, added `--model-identifier`
   - **KeywordGeneratorCLI**: Removed Ollama options, added Foundation Models support
   - **BenchmarkCLI**: New benchmarking tool for performance measurement

5. **Updated Package.swift**
   - Removed `async-http-client` dependency
   - Updated platform requirements to macOS 15.0+ and iOS 18.0+
   - Added BenchmarkCLI executable target

### Documentation Changes

1. **README.md**
   - Updated all references from Ollama to Foundation Models
   - Updated requirements section
   - Added benchmarking section
   - Updated troubleshooting section
   - Added migration notes

2. **Created FOUNDATION_MODELS_API_NOTES.md**
   - Notes about API verification needed
   - Known issues and next steps

3. **Created MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** (this file)
   - Complete migration documentation

### New Features

1. **Benchmarking System**
   - `Benchmark.swift`: Core benchmarking functionality
   - `BenchmarkCLI`: Command-line benchmarking tool
   - Performance comparison capabilities

## Breaking Changes

1. **Platform Requirements**
   - **Before**: macOS 13+ or iOS 16+
   - **After**: macOS 15.0+ (Sequoia) or iOS 18.0+

2. **No External Dependencies**
   - **Before**: Required Ollama server running
   - **After**: No external services needed (on-device processing)

3. **CLI Options**
   - Removed: `--ollama-url`, `--model` (Ollama-specific)
   - Added: `--model-identifier` (Foundation Models)

## Known Issues

1. **FoundationModels API Verification Needed**
   - The exact API structure needs to be verified
   - `SystemLanguageModel` initialization may need adjustment
   - Text generation method name may differ
   - Response structure may vary

   See `FOUNDATION_MODELS_API_NOTES.md` for details.

## Testing Status

- ✅ Code migration completed
- ✅ CLI tools updated
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ⚠️ Tests need updating (blocked by API verification)
- ⚠️ Compilation errors need resolution (API structure)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify FoundationModels API**
   - Check Apple's documentation
   - Test API calls in isolation
   - Fix compilation errors

2. **Update Tests**
   - Update test files to use Foundation Models
   - Remove Ollama-specific test cases
   - Add Foundation Models test cases

3. **Run Benchmarks**
   - Compare performance with previous Ollama version
   - Document performance improvements

4. **Update Release Notes**
   - Document migration in release notes
   - Update Homebrew formula
   - Create migration guide for users

## Benefits of Migration

1. **No External Dependencies**: No need to run Ollama server
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized for Apple Silicon
3. **Privacy**: All processing happens on-device
4. **Integration**: Native Apple framework integration
5. **Simplicity**: Fewer moving parts, easier deployment

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the previous Ollama-based version is available in git history. To rollback:

```bash
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>
```

However, we recommend fixing the FoundationModels API issues rather than rolling back, as Foundation Models provides significant benefits.
